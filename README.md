# Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction-Model
This repository contains code and data for a rock vs. mine classification project. 
The model is trained on sonar data and aims to accurately distinguish between rocks and underwater mines.
This repo provides a complete workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training and performance evaluation.
